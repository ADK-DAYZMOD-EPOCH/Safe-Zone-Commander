Version History


Update v0.2:
- You can now change the setting '_safeZone_Vehicles_AllowGearFromWithinVehicles' to allow the gear screen to open while the player is inside a vehicle.

Update v0.2.1
- Fixed a potential issue where vehicles would sometimes not be able to fire their weapon even after leaving a trader zone.

Update v0.2.2
- Missed 'then' on an if statement - serves me right for coding it at work :p

Update v0.2.3
- Fixed godmode not turning off when exiting a safe zone.

Update v0.3
- Fixed a lot of problems due to me attempting to use private variables outside of the scope that they were created in (oops!).

Update v0.4
- Fixed public vars being declared as private vars, causing the script to not load. (Darn you Find & Replace!)

All should be working okay for this release.
